# Pandas_Data_Cleaning
# Pandas
Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library built on top of Python. It provides flexible data structures like Series and DataFrame for working with structured data efficiently.

## 🔹 Common use cases:

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing

✅ Statistical analysis and visualization

✅ Handling missing values

✅ Grouping and aggregation

# Pandas Test  

### Problem Statement 

Use Pandas to perform numerical computations and data analysis on a dataset. This 
assignment introduces students to essential data analysis libraries in Python. 
Detailed ExplanationPandas Data Analysis: 

### ✅ Loading Data: 

1) Read a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. 

### Data Cleaning: 

2) Identify and handle missing values (e.g., using fillna() or dropna()). 

3) Convert data types if necessary. 

4) Quantity missing values should ne filed with mean quantity 

5) Missing region should be filled with “central” 

6) Duplicates should be removed 

7) Missing Sub-category should be filled with “Not mentioned” 

8) Filler the data only sales >1000 

9) Sort the data based on sales 

10) Convert to CSV File

# Pandas Mini Practice 

## Mini Project : Develop a Simple Data Analysis Application 

### Problem Statement 

Create a Python application that reads data from a file, processes it, and presents the results. 
This project applies programming and data analysis skills to build a functional application. 

### Options Include

#### Sales Data Processing:

✅Read sales data and compute total sales per product. 

✅Identify the best-selling products and sales trends over category and sub-category 
Detailed Explanation 

#### Application Requirements: 

##### Data Input: 

1) Read data from a file (e.g., CSV, JSON).
   
2) Ensure the application can handle different file sizes gracefully.
   
##### 🔹Data Processing: 

🔹Clean and preprocess the data as necessary.
   
3) Duplicates should be removed
   
4) Sub-category blanks should be filled with “not mentioned”
   
5) Quantity blanks should be filled with “mean of quantity”
   
##### Implement functions to perform required calculations 

1) Avg sales
   
2) Mean Quantity 
 
3) Mode of Quantity 

4) Standard deviation of quantity  

5) Correlation between sales and Profit 

6) Create a function – Need to add a new column as “Status” if quantity is greater 
than 5 then “High sales” else “low sales”

##### Results Presentation : 
  
1) Ship mode vs quantity – pie chart 

2) Category vs profit -bar chart 

3) Sub-category vs profit line chart 

4) State vs sales – scatter chart 

5) Region vs sales – any plot 

6) Count of high/low region wise - any plot
   
###### Answer the following Questions 

1) How duplicated you found in the data? 

2) How many blanks found in Sub-category 

3) What is the avg sales
 
4) What is total profit 

5) Which region getting higher sales 

6) Which ship mode customer like to ship
